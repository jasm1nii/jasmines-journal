## onsite

- [ayano's neocities comment widget](https://virtualobserver.moe/ayano/comment-widget)

    requires google forms, but is fully customizable as far as i know.

- [HTML comment box](https://www.htmlcommentbox.com/)

    one of the more stylish options out of the box; most elements can be customized, but branding is not removable for free users.

- [cactus comments](https://cactus.chat/)

    open source comment box with [matrix](https://matrix.org/) account integration (required). can be used with static site generators, such as hugo etc.

- [disqus](https://disqus.com/)

    while being very feature-rich, the styling is not customizable at all. needs the plus plan to remove advertisements.

## offsite

- [123guestbook](https://www.123guestbook.com/)

    very limited customization options and a bit dated appearance-wise, but provides IP blocking, email collection, inbox notifications, custom input fields, as well as manual comment approval.
