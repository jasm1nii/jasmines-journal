### embeddable

- [comment widget by ayano](https://virtualobserver.moe/ayano/comment-widget)

    requires google forms.

- [HTML comment box](https://www.htmlcommentbox.com/)

    one of the more stylish options out of the box; most elements can be customized, but branding is not removable for free users.

- [cactus comments](https://cactus.chat/)

    open source comment box with [matrix](https://matrix.org/) account integration (required), and a default stylesheet that looks great on most sites. supports markdown and can be used with static site generators, such as hugo etc.

- [disqus](https://disqus.com/)

    while being very feature-rich, the styling is not customizable at all. needs the plus plan to remove advertisements.

    a comment widget powered by github issues!
