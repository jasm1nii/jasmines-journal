### accessibility references

**a free internet is an accessible internet** - ideally, a website's design should accommodate a wide range of visitors, included disabled people and assistive technology users.

- [the ultimate *** website üëë](https://theultimatemotherfuckingwebsite.com/)

    i actually found this site from [frills' accessibility master post!](https://fri11s.neocities.org/blog/accessibility/)

- for checking the accessibility of my website, i personally use the following tools in tandem:

    - [<abbr title="web accessibility evaluation tool">WAVE</abbr>](https://wave.webaim.org/)

    - [axe browser extensions by deque](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/)

## extending the basics

### quick tools

- [CSS generators](https://css-generators.com/)

- [CSS portal](https://www.cssportal.com/)

### libraries

these resources can help keep your code more consistent and reduce the redundancy of typing boilerplate for each page.

*view the full list: [/resources/webdev/libraries](/resources/webdev/libraries).*

### templating languages

- [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug#syntax)

    pug uses whitespace and indentation instead of tags for rendering HTML. it has a few other features, such as includes, template inheritance, and markdown rendering.
    
    it is possible to skip `npm install` entirely and compile pug within vscode using the [compile hero](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wscats.qf) extension. a [command line interface](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-cli) is also available.

    pug is also available for PHP as [phug](https://phug-lang.com/).

- [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/)

    a template engine for PHP, with syntax akin to [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for javascript and [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/templates/) for python. also supports converting markdown to html and vice versa.

- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

    a CSS preprocessor - super useful for polyfilling nested styles and vendor prefixes for older browsers. sass variables are also much more flexible than regular CSS variables.
    
    sass can be precompiled with [compile hero](https://github.com/Wscats/compile-hero) or [live sass compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) for vscode.

### develop & deploy

- [deploy-to-neocities github action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities)

- [prepos](https://prepros.io/)

    a standalone compiler program that supports many templating languages and language extensions, such as sass, tailwind CSS, pug, and markdown. it can also compress javascript, CSS, and image files. comes with a built-in web server, too!
