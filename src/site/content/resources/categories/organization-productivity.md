## notes and knowledge management

- [milanote ‚≠ê](https://www.milanote.com/refer/rcB9bGTYRYfxh0S1uO)

    really helpful for visualizing ideas and mapping them out!

    i've personally found this better suited to team collaboration. it's also much cheaper to scale than notion, but the mobile app is still a bit barebones at the moment.

    you don't even need an account to use this - notes are stored and edited offline. you can even use custom HTML and CSS! but if you're used to detail-rich kanban boards, calendars, and databases (like in notion and coda), you'll need to spend a lot of time finding the right extensions.
