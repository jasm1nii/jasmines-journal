        - fixed some quirks in the backend and rewrote the request router functions.
        - added two new sites to the link gallery.
        - made microblogging easier on my end by writing a shell script to automatically create new posts from a template, so i'll be posting notes a lot more frequently ðŸ˜—âœŒ unless it's super important, new notes won't be mentioned in the changelog, so follow my [atom feed](/notes.xml) to keep up with my mundane thoughts ðŸ˜‰
