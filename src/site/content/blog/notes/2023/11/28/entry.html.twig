        check-in time - i fell off hard with task tracking for the past few days due to a bought of PMS. did not get in my daily dose of physical activity either, and i still haven't made much progress with the current after effects scene i'm working on â˜¹ i have less than a month to get this done, but i keep hyperfocusing on the wrong things.
