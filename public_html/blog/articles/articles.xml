(oddly enough, i can still receive password&lt;br /&gt;&#13;reset emails, but none of the links go through.)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;all that aside‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve since forked out some cash to reupload my&lt;br /&gt;&#13;website (again) to a more established hosting service under&lt;br /&gt;&#13;a new domain, but i don‚Äôt plan&lt;br /&gt;&#13;on leaving ichi.city behind.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;i miss connecting with people via neocities‚Äô discovery feed, and i&lt;br /&gt;&#13;genuinely enjoyed the social aspect of the service - sometimes, it&lt;br /&gt;&#13;feels a bit lonely existing within an isolated pocket of my own. i&lt;br /&gt;&#13;liked being able to share what i‚Äôve made for myself without&lt;br /&gt;&#13;persistently promoting myself on other social media platforms or&lt;br /&gt;&#13;‚Äúimproving my SEO‚Äù, and i don‚Äôt feel like venturing very far&lt;br /&gt;&#13;outside of the smaller, cozier communities that already exist&lt;br /&gt;&#13;within the indie web.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;so with that said, i‚Äôll continue mirroring ‚Äújasmine‚Äôs journal‚Äù to https://jasm1nii.ichi.city/ for as long as i‚Äôm able to, or at least until i hit the upper limit of my allotted storage space (10 megabytes, to be exact). for reference, this website takes up a grand total of around 4 MB on my hard drive, but it will likely explode in size once i get my illustration gallery up. while i have more than enough room to accommodate for these planned additions on my paid hosting service, i can‚Äôt guarantee that i‚Äôll reupload everything to ichi, but i‚Äôll try to work around the limit by using fallback links or uploading my images to dropbox instead.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;and now a message from our sponsors* ‚ù£&lt;br /&gt;&#13;*i am sharing this link out of my own free will, and nobody is paying me anything.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;wanna store your files on a service that isn‚Äôt google drive? dropbox‚Äôs free tier starts off at 2 GB, but you can get 500 MB extra storage space if you use&lt;br /&gt;&#13;my referral link and download dropbox for desktop.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;p.s. - i've enabled webmentions, by the way! at the moment, my brain isn't big enough for understanding how to fetch and display them automatically, but that's probably for the best. i'll stick with manually adding reposts to prevent spam. for now, have a comment box -&lt;br /&gt;&#13;please be kind!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;</content></entry><entry><title>bye neocities | jasmine's b(rain)log</title><id>https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/articles/2023/8/12/entry.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/articles/2023/8/12/entry.html"/><updated>2023-08-12T00:00:00+07:00</updated><published>2023-08-12T00:00:00+07:00</published><content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;&#13;bye neocities&lt;br /&gt;&#13;12 august 2023&lt;br /&gt;&#13;hi, ichi.city!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;this website is a carbon copy of what used to be hosted on&lt;br /&gt;&#13;neocities. my site was taken down without warning, and i can't log&lt;br /&gt;&#13;into my profile there.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;therefore, there's probably a lot of broken links and out-of-context&lt;br /&gt;&#13;writing that's specific to neocities. i'll fix stuff eventually on&lt;br /&gt;&#13;my own time.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;for now, please abstain from linking to my old URL at https://jasm1nii.neocities.org/ until further notice - you can link to this one, instead.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;</content></entry><entry><title>parroting a broken record held together by elmer's glue | jasmine's b(rain)log</title><id>https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/articles/2023/8/09/entry.html</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/articles/2023/8/09/entry.html"/><updated>2023-08-09T00:00:00+07:00</updated><published>2023-08-09T00:00:00+07:00</published><content type="html">&lt;br /&gt;&#13;parroting a broken record held together by elmer's glue&lt;br /&gt;&#13;9 august 2023&lt;br /&gt;&#13;(context if you don't know what elmer's glue is)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;the staple of every USian classroom, only good for cruddy papier-m√¢ch√©, and nothing more:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;i'm no stranger to writing long posts‚Ñ¢ on the internet - and yet, spelling out my thoughts sans parsing via instagram stories and tweets remains a daunting task. i feel ridiculous for not being able to drop my social anxiety in a space supposedly curated for me and me only, but you know what they say about old habits.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;maybe with time, i might see that change.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;why posting my thoughts on private accounts doesn't cut it for me (1 paragraph)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;in short: i don't really know who to include in those circles anymore, and keeping all of this to myself in my actual journal feels... inadequate. none of the previous channels i've tried were cathartic enough for my autistic social needs - spacehey is a close contender, though. i'm doing this all on a whim, crossing my fingers that i'll connect with the right people by putting stuff wherever i'm more likely to find them.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;-&lt;br /&gt;&#13;anyways, i'm not sure what to say in this post that hasn't already been said an uncountable number of times across the indie web (very much past the point of becoming a tired cliche). i just hope that i'll be able to make the most out of what i've already crafted - knowing how much effort i've put forth up until this point, it would be a waste not to.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;</content></entry></feed>
