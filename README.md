# jasmine's journal
welcome to my hand-crafted personal website and coding sandbox ðŸ› 

this site was first launched to neocities july 2023; i was pretty happy there until it was [taken down without warning](https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/2023/august/12/entry) when it was barely one month old.  
since then, i've moved my hosting to [rumahweb](https://www.rumahweb.com/) under a new domain: https://jasm1nii.xyz/

a mirror of the website can also be accessed via https://jasm1nii.ichi.city/

feel free to reference the code, but **reuploads of any of the files are not authorized** (with the exception of scripts sourced from third parties - see the [credits page](https://jasm1nii.xyz/credits) for more info).
