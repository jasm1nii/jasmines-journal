## local deployment guide

### important note

as of now, graceful error handling does not exist for missing database credentials. if this repository is deployed as is, PHP will throw a fatal error when viewing certain pages that require them (namely the homepage and the guestbook).

### base requirements

- [**PHP 8**](https://www.php.net/) or newer.

- [**composer**](https://getcomposer.org/) for updating PHP dependencies.
    
    if you'd prefer not to install composer globally, the executable `composer.phar` file (located in the `bin` directory) can be used instead - more on that in the instructions.

- **MariaDB** or **MySQL** for the database.

### general instructions

1. **clone this repository** to your machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jasm1nii/jasmines-journal
    ```

    [compressed archives](https://github.com/jasm1nii/jasmines-journal/releases) are also available for direct download.

2. **install the required dependencies** - running these commands in the project's root directory should download them to a new folder named `vendor`:

    - option #1 - via `composer` (global installation):

        ```bash
        composer install
        ```

    - option #2 - via `composer.phar`:

        ```bash
        php bin/composer.phar install
        ```

2. **configure your web server** to use `public_html` as the document root, as well as to redirect requests for nonexistent files to `index.php`.

    - **for apache**, an `.htaccess` file is already included to handle the latter, but ensure to set the former in your `httpd.conf` file.


3. **that's it!** you can now view this site at whatever localhost address you've set ðŸ‘¾
