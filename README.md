## local deployment guide

### base requirements

- [**PHP 8**](https://www.php.net/) or newer.

- [**composer**](https://getcomposer.org/) for updating PHP dependencies.
    
    if you'd prefer not to install composer globally, the executable `composer.phar` file (located in the `/bin` directory) can be used instead - more on that in the instructions.

- **MariaDB** or **MySQL** for the database.

### general instructions

1. **clone this repository** to your machine:

    1.  via `composer` (global installation) - this will automatically  install the required dependencies:

        - latest:

            ```bash
            composer create-project jasm1nii/jasmines-journal:dev-main
            ```

        - stable:

            ```bash
            composer create-project jasm1nii/jasmines-journal
            ```

    2. via `git` CLI:

        - latest:

            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/jasm1nii/jasmines-journal
            ```

        - stable:

            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/jasm1nii/jasmines-journal --branch (version tag)
            ```

    3. via direct download as a `.zip` archive:
    
        - [latest](https://github.com/jasm1nii/jasmines-journal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

        - [stable](https://github.com/jasm1nii/jasmines-journal/releases)


2. if you haven't already, **install the required dependencies**:

    1. via `composer` (global installation):

        ```bash
        composer install
        ```

    2. via `composer.phar`:

        ```bash
        php bin/composer.phar install
        ```


3. **configure your web server** to use `/public_html` as the document root, as well as to redirect requests for nonexistent files to `/public_html/index.php`.

    - **for apache**, an `.htaccess` file is already included to handle the latter, but ensure to set the former in your `httpd.conf` file.


4. **that's it!** you can now view this site at whatever localhost address you've set ðŸ‘¾

### additional configuration

per version 2.3, a `guestbook_sample.sql` file is provided in the `/resources/databases` directory. to use it, you'll need to import the file manually to your server database. after that, tweak any parameters as needed in `/config/env_sample.ini` and `/config/src_paths.php`.
