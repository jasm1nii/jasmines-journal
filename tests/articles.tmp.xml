        <summary>a short food post!</summary>

    &lt;p&gt;
      what&#039;s cookin&#039;? üç≥
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      a little intermezzo - if you haven&#039;t noticed already, i changed the typeface for my blog entries! 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;details&gt;
        &lt;summary&gt;why the change?&lt;/summary&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
      in short, i wanted the &quot;tone&quot; of my published writing to match that of my drafts.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
      i started experimenting with monospace type for writing in notion and obsidian some time ago, and the difference was night and day. perhaps this is due to the more &quot;polished&quot; appearance of sans serif type&amp;shy;faces, but allowing my personal thoughts to flow onto the page felt... &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder, for some reason. and while i quite like instrument sans - which is the typeface that i used before (and still use for the rest of my website) - my thinking just didn&#039;t read back as naturally to me.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            anyways...! i wanted to post something easy this time around and talk about something other than webmastery, so here&#039;s a mini food log of my meals from the past few weeks!
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;section class=&quot;scrapbook&quot;&gt;

        <summary>new beginnings</summary>
        <content type="html">
            &lt;p&gt;
        update - a very funny thing happened last night &lt;em&gt;right after&lt;/em&gt; i posted my blog yesterday:
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://jasm1nii.xyz/_assets/media/blog/articles/2023/8/17/email.png&quot; alt=&quot;on friday, august 11th 2023, i wrote to neocities support with the follow message: &amp;#34;hello, my website (https://jasm1nii.neocities.org/) and profile suddenly disappeared a few moments ago - opening them leads to a &amp;#34;page not found&amp;#34; error. i am still able to receive password reset emails, but the links do not follow through, and i can&#039;t sign in. may i get some clarity as to what happened, and is it possible to get my site back up?&amp;#34;. attached above my message is a reply from neocities support, sent thursday, august 17th, 2023: &amp;#34;My sincere apologies for the delay and issues, we are receiving record support requests right now. I believe we have this resolved for you and you should be able to login again. Again, please accept my apologies for the extreme delay in response and the issues.#34;&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        now, being on &lt;em&gt;three different web hosts&lt;/em&gt; just feels excessive, so the new plan is to set up a splash page with a redirect on ichi and neocities! will get around to that in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0dkc9RvSdJe0NcdAD2ubHR?utm_source=generator&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;152&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        i‚Äôve been meaning to talk more about this unwelcome change once i have properly settled into my new web host, so here‚Äôs an updated recap of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/2023/august/12/entry&quot;&gt;my recent departure from neocities&lt;/a&gt;. full disclosure - nearly a week has passed since both the website and its associated profile was taken down, and i still don‚Äôt know why. i‚Äôve already contacted support, but i‚Äôve yet to receive a response. (oddly enough, i can still receive password reset emails, but none of the links go through.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      all that aside‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve since forked out some cash to reupload my
      website (again) to a more established hosting service under
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasm1nii.xyz/&quot;&gt;a new domain&lt;/a&gt;, but i don‚Äôt plan
      on leaving ichi.city behind.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      i miss connecting with people via neocities‚Äô discovery feed, and i
      genuinely enjoyed the social aspect of the service - sometimes, it
      feels a bit lonely existing within an isolated pocket of my own. i
      liked being able to share what i‚Äôve made for myself without
      persistently promoting myself on other social media platforms or
      ‚Äúimproving my SEO‚Äù, and i don‚Äôt feel like venturing very far
      outside of the smaller, cozier communities that already exist
      within the indie web.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      so with that said, i‚Äôll continue mirroring ‚Äújasmine‚Äôs journal‚Äù to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasm1nii.ichi.city/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;https://jasm1nii.ichi.city/&lt;/a&gt; for as long as i‚Äôm able to, or at least until i hit the upper limit of my allotted storage space (&lt;a href=&quot;https://10mbmanifesto.neocities.org/&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;10 megabytes&lt;/a&gt;, to be exact). for reference, this website takes up a grand total of around 4 MB on my hard drive, but it will likely explode in size once i get my illustration gallery up. while i have more than enough room to accommodate for these planned additions on my paid hosting service, i can‚Äôt guarantee that i‚Äôll reupload everything to ichi, but i‚Äôll try to work around the limit by using fallback links or uploading my images to dropbox instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;details&gt;
      &lt;summary&gt;
        and now a message from our sponsors* ‚ù£
        &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;
          *i am sharing this link out of my own free will, and nobody is paying me anything.
        &lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/summary&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        wanna store your files on a service that isn‚Äôt google drive? dropbox‚Äôs free tier starts off at 2 GB, but you can get 500 MB extra storage space if you use
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AAB2Zm7DYc9hrkpj3Tb3fr8jMPDiZdk_Po0?src=global9&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;my referral link&lt;/a&gt; and download dropbox for desktop.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/details&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      p.s. - i&#039;ve enabled &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/Webmention&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;webmentions&lt;/a&gt;, by the way! at the moment, my brain isn&#039;t big enough for understanding how to fetch and display them automatically, but that&#039;s probably for the best. i&#039;ll stick with manually adding reposts to prevent spam. for now, have a comment box -
      please be kind!

            &lt;p&gt;
    hi, ichi.city!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    this website is a carbon copy of what used to be hosted on
    neocities. my site was taken down without warning, and i can&#039;t log
    into my profile there.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    therefore, there&#039;s probably a lot of broken links and out-of-context
    writing that&#039;s specific to neocities. i&#039;ll fix stuff eventually on
    my own time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    for now, please abstain from linking to my old URL at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasm1nii.neocities.org/&quot; rel=&quot;external me&quot;&gt;https://jasm1nii.neocities.org/&lt;/a&gt; until further notice - you can link to this one, instead.

      &lt;details&gt;
          &lt;summary&gt;(context if you don&#039;t know what elmer&#039;s glue is)
          &lt;/summary&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
              the staple of every USian classroom, only good for cruddy papier-m√¢ch√©, and nothing more:
              &lt;img src=&quot;https://jasm1nii.xyz/_assets/media/blog/articles/2023/8/09/elmers.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; alt=&quot;a photo of elmer&#039;s washable school glue&quot;&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;hr&gt;
      &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      i&#039;m no stranger to writing long posts‚Ñ¢ on the internet - and yet, spelling out my thoughts sans parsing via instagram stories and tweets remains a daunting task. i feel ridiculous for not being able to drop my social anxiety in a space supposedly curated &lt;em&gt;for me and me only&lt;/em&gt;, but you know what they say about old habits.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      maybe with time, i might see that change.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;details&gt;
          &lt;summary&gt;why posting my thoughts on private accounts doesn&#039;t cut it for me (1 paragraph)&lt;/summary&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
              in short: i don&#039;t really know who to include in those circles anymore, and keeping all of this to myself in my actual journal feels... &lt;em&gt;inadequate&lt;/em&gt;. none of the previous channels i&#039;ve tried were cathartic enough for my autistic social needs - &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacehey.com/jasm1nii&quot; rel=&quot;external me&quot;&gt;spacehey&lt;/a&gt; is a close contender, though. i&#039;m doing this all on a whim, crossing my fingers that i&#039;ll connect with the right people by putting stuff wherever i&#039;m more likely to find them.
          &lt;/p&gt;
          -
      &lt;/details&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
      anyways, i&#039;m not sure what to say in this post that hasn&#039;t already been said an uncountable number of times across the indie web (very much past the point of becoming a tired cliche). i just hope that i&#039;ll be able to make the most out of what i&#039;ve already crafted - knowing how much effort i&#039;ve put forth up until this point, it would be a waste &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to.
