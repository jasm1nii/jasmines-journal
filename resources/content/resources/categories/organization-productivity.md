## notes and knowledge management

- [milanote](https://www.milanote.com/refer/rcB9bGTYRYfxh0S1uO) ⭐

    really helpful for visualizing ideas and mapping them out!

    this is my go-to app for... almost everything. seamlessly integrates with many third-party apps (like google calendar, dropbox, and github). notes can be exported as PDFs, markdown files, or HTML pages.

    i've personally found this better suited to team collaboration - much cheaper to scale, as well - but the mobile app is still a bit barebones at the moment.

    you don't even need an account to use this - notes are stored and edited offline. you can even use custom HTML and CSS! but if you're used to detail-rich kanban boards, calendars, and databases (like in notion and coda), you'll need to spend a lot of time finding the right extensions.
