## getting started

### site hosting services

it's a good idea to figure out your needs firsthand before deciding where to host your website.

do you prefer something that comes with an intuitive site builder, or would you rather work with raw code - mayhaps even do some backend magic with node.js or PHP? check out a list of options at [/resources/webdev/site-hosts](/resources/webdev/site-hosts).

### site templates

if you decide to go down the route of hand-coding everything with vanilla HTML and CSS, you can check out these HTML templates to get started quickly:

- pre-made layouts:
    - [nonkiru's layouts](https://nonkiru.art/layouts)
    - [sadgrl's layouts](https://sadgrl.online/webmastery/layouts/)
