      what's cookin'? 🍳
    </p>
    <p>
      a little intermezzo - if you haven't noticed already, i changed the typeface for my blog entries! 
    </p>
    <p>
      <details>
        <summary>why the change?</summary>
        <p>
      in short, i wanted the "tone" of my published writing to match that of my drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
      i started experimenting with monospace type for writing in notion and obsidian some time ago, and the difference was night and day. perhaps this is due to the more "polished" appearance of sans serif type&shy;faces, but allowing my personal thoughts to flow onto the page felt... <em>much</em> harder, for some reason. and while i quite like instrument sans - which is the typeface that i used before (and still use for the rest of my website) - my thinking just didn't read back as naturally to me.
