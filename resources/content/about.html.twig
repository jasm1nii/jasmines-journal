        **welcome to my digital sandbox!**
        
        "jasmine's journal" was created as a personal project in july 2023. its inception was mainly driven by a desire to reclaim my online presence, as well as my growing discontent with modern social media.

        by extension, this website also serves as an experimental canvas to sharpen my coding skills. it is coded entirely by hand - an initially daunting task as someone who's never opened a real code editor until one month prior. nevertheless, i'm proud to say that i've learned a lot since then!

        with that in mind, i intend to use this space to showcase whatever i want, however i want - whether that be personal interests, my thoughts on various subjects, or stuff i've worked on.

    <h4>how i got started with coding</h4>
    <p>
        i first dipped my toes in front-end design as an elementary student toying with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_(website)" rel="external">multiply</a> blog layouts - back when i was <em>definitely</em> too young to be on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        toying around in their onsite code editor was a favorite pastime for me, up until the service shut down in the early 2010s. afterwards, i didn't code for <em>years</em>, as the newer, more popular "social" networks didn't allow for customization to that extent*, and the notion of self-hosting a site never really came to mind.
    <p>
        it wasn't until i caught wind of sites like <a href="https://cohost.org/" rel="external">cohost</a>, <a href="https://spacehey.com/" rel="external">spacehey</a>, and <a href="https://neocities.org/" rel="external">neocities</a> in my early 20s, when i rediscovered the joy of creative coding and carving out your own space online. through the independent web revival, i was finally re-incentivized to brush up on my "lost skills"... so, here i am!
        <br/>

    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        while i don't have a formal education in web development, my sense of layouting and aesthetics is largely influenced by my undergraduate background in visual communication design with a concentration in multimedia.
    </p>
    <p>
        by experience, i'm <em>much</em> more accustomed to outputting non-interactive visual work, such as illustrations, graphic designs, and motion art - but i hope to show more of that here as this site comes together! <span aria-hidden="true">&#10023;</span>
