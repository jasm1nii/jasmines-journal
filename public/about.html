                                    welcome to my digital sandbox! this website was constructed <mark>from the ground up</mark> by the power of <em>intense curiosity</em> and my desire for a digital self-expression medium with fewer restraints.

                                    with that in mind, i fully intend to use this space to showcase <mark>whatever i want, however i want</mark> - whether that be personal interests, or stuff i've worked on.

                                <p>
                                    <b>like many people on <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>,</b> i'm entirely <mark>self-taught</mark> in HTML and CSS. i first dipped my toes in front-end design as an elementary student toying with <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_(website)">multiply blog</a> layouts</b> (back when i was <em>definitely</em> too young to be on the internet). sadly, i abandoned my humble insite text editor when the service shut down and didn't code for <em>years</em> afterwards, as the newer, more popular "social" networks didn't allow for customization to that extent.*
                                </p>
                                <small>
                                    * except for tumblr, but it never felt "cozy" enough some reason...
                                </small>
                                <p>
                                    it wasn't until i caught wind of sites like <b>cohost, spacehey, and neocities</b> that i was incentivized to brush up on my "lost skills". <mark>i <em>needed</em> alternative spaces where i could be more genuine</mark> with less pressure to censor my thoughts... and here i am!
                                </p>
                                <hr>
                                <p>
                                    while i don't have a formal education in web development, my sense of layouting and aesthetics is largely influenced by my undergraduate background in <mark>visual communication design</mark> with a  concentration in <mark>multimedia.</mark> by experience, i'm <em>much</em> more accustomed to outputting non-interactive visual work, such as illustrations, graphic designs, and motion art - so i hope to eventually show off my full range of skills  as this site comes together! &#10023;
