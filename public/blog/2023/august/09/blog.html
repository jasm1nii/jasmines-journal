                        i'm no stranger to writing long postsâ„¢ on the internet - and yet, spelling out my thoughts sans parsing via instagram stories and tweets remains a daunting task. i feel ridiculous for not being able to drop my social anxiety in a space supposedly curated <em>for me and me only</em>, but you know what they say about old habits.

                        maybe with time, i might see that change.

                            <p>
                                in short: i don't really know who to include in those circles anymore, and keeping all of this to myself in my actual journal feels... <em>inadequate</em>. none of the previous channels i've tried were cathartic enough for my autistic social needs - <a href="https://spacehey.com/jasm1nii" rel="external me">spacehey</a> is a close contender, though. i'm doing this all on a whim, crossing my fingers that i'll connect with the right people by putting stuff wherever i'm more likely to find them.

                        anyways, i'm not sure what to say in this post that hasn't already been said an uncountable number of times across the indie web (very much past the point of becoming a tired cliche). i just hope that i'll be able to make the most out of what i've already crafted - knowing how much effort i've put forth up until this point, it would be a waste <em>not</em> to.

                                okay, going off the rails for a bit since this just popped into my head - i actually thought about majoring in computer science early in my high school years. but to my disadvantage, my grades for math and other prerequisite subjects <em>seriously</em> sucked. soon enough, i came to terms with reality and refocused my efforts towards applying to various art and design programs - and it worked out in the end...! <del>until i hit burnout, that is.</del> however, i'd like to note that, despite being truly passionate about the field, not feeling like i had any other option back then because of my poor academic performance was still a major deciding factor. (thanks, undiagnosed neurodivergencies.)

                                it  wasn't always like this; if anything, school used to be a breeze before i moved back to my country of birth. i'll acknowledge that, at the time, my incompetence in the language definitely played a part in exacerbating my negative experiences with the indonesian education system, but i was also subjected to a lot of unsavory experiences - perhaps one day, i'll talk about this in a longer post of its own.
