            <p>
              update - a very funny thing happened last night <em>right after</em> i posted my blog yesterday:
              <br>
              <img src="/blog/articles/2023/8/17/email.png" alt="on friday, august 11th 2023, i wrote to neocities support with the follow message: &#34;hello, my website (https://jasm1nii.neocities.org/) and profile suddenly disappeared a few moments ago - opening them leads to a &#34;page not found&#34; error. i am still able to receive password reset emails, but the links do not follow through, and i can't sign in. may i get some clarity as to what happened, and is it possible to get my site back up?&#34;. attached above my message is a reply from neocities support, sent thursday, august 17th, 2023: &#34;My sincere apologies for the delay and issues, we are receiving record support requests right now. I believe we have this resolved for you and you should be able to login again. Again, please accept my apologies for the extreme delay in response and the issues.#34;">
            </p>
            <p>
              now, being on <em>three different web hosts</em> just feels excessive, so the new plan is to set up a splash page with a redirect on ichi and neocities! will get around to that in the near future.

            <br>
            <p>
              i’ve been meaning to talk more about this unwelcome change once i
              have properly settled into my new web host, so here’s an updated
              recap of
              <a href="https://jasm1nii.xyz/blog/2023/august/12/entry">my recent departure from neocities</a>. full disclosure - nearly a week has passed since both the
              website and its associated profile was taken down, and i still
              don’t know why. i’ve already contacted support, but i’ve yet to
              receive a response. (oddly enough, i can still receive password
              reset emails, but none of the links go through.)
            </p>
            <p>
              all that aside… i’ve since forked out some cash to reupload my
              website (again) to a more established hosting service under
              <a href="https://jasm1nii.xyz/">a new domain</a>, but i don’t plan
              on leaving ichi.city behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              i miss connecting with people via neocities’ discovery feed, and i
              genuinely enjoyed the social aspect of the service - sometimes, it
              feels a bit lonely existing within an isolated pocket of my own. i
              liked being able to share what i’ve made for myself without
              persistently promoting myself on other social media platforms or
              “improving my SEO”, and i don’t feel like venturing very far
              outside of the smaller, cozier communities that already exist
              within the indie web.
            </p>
            <p>
              so with that said, i’ll continue mirroring “jasmine’s journal” to <a href="https://jasm1nii.ichi.city/" rel="external">https://jasm1nii.ichi.city/</a> for as long as i’m able to, or at least until i hit the upper limit of my allotted storage space (<a href="https://10mbmanifesto.neocities.org/" rel="external">10 megabytes</a>, to be exact). for reference, this website takes up a grand total of around 4 MB on my hard drive, but it will likely explode in size once i get my illustration gallery up. while i have more than enough room to accommodate for these planned additions on my paid hosting service, i can’t guarantee that i’ll reupload everything to ichi, but i’ll try to work around the limit by using fallback links or uploading my images to dropbox instead.

                wanna store your files on a service that isn’t google drive? dropbox’s free tier starts off at 2 GB, but you can get 500 MB extra storage space if you use
                <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/AAB2Zm7DYc9hrkpj3Tb3fr8jMPDiZdk_Po0?src=global9" rel="external">my referral link</a> and download dropbox for desktop.

              p.s. - i've enabled <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention" rel="external">webmentions</a>, by the way! at the moment, my brain isn't big enough for understanding how to fetch and display them automatically, but that's probably for the best. i'll stick with manually adding reposts to prevent spam. for now, have a comment box -
              please be kind!
