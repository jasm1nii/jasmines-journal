                            <p>
                                <b>welcome to my digital sandbox!</b> the creation of this website in july 2023 was motivated by a personal desire to reclaim my online presence and explore a digital self-expression medium with fewer restraints, beyond what corporate social media and other content hosts are currently capable of offering.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                it is coded entirely by hand without the use of conventional site builder tools - an initially daunting task as someone without any serious web development experience beforehand. but i'm proud to say that i've learned a lot since embarking on this journey!
                            <p>
                                with that in mind, i fully intend to use this space to showcase whatever i want, however i want - whether that be personal interests, my thoughts on various subjects, or stuff i've worked on.

                            <h3>my background</h3>
                            <p>
                                like many people on the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="external">indie web</a>, i'm entirely self-taught in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. i first dipped my toes in front-end design as an elementary student toying with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply_(website)" rel="external">multiply</a> blog layouts (back when i was <em>definitely</em> too young to be on the internet). sadly, i abandoned my humble insite text editor when the service shut down and didn't code for <em>years</em> afterwards, as the newer, more popular "social" networks didn't allow for customization to that extent, save for tumblr.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                it wasn't until i caught wind of sites like <a href="https://cohost.org/" rel="external">cohost</a>, <a href="https://spacehey.com/" rel="external">spacehey</a>, and <a href="https://neocities.org/" rel="external">neocities</a> that i was incentivized to brush up on my "lost skills". i <em>needed</em> alternative spaces where i could be more genuine with less pressure to conform to the norms of commercial social networks... so, here i am! <span aria-label="smile" role="img">‡´Æ À∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂ ·Éê</span>
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                while i don't have a formal education in web development, my sense of layouting and aesthetics is largely influenced by my undergraduate background in visual communication design, with a concentration in multimedia. by experience, i'm <em>much</em> more accustomed to outputting non-interactive visual work, such as illustrations, graphic designs, and motion art - but i hope to show more of that here as this site comes together! &#10023;
